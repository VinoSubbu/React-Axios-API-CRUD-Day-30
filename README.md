# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


#AXOIS TASK
Creating an Axios CRUD project in ReactJS involves leveraging Axios, a robust library for making HTTP requests, to handle the essential Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Begin by setting up Axios within your React application and defining API endpoints that correspond to each CRUD action. For instance, use axios.post() to send data for creating new items, axios.get() to fetch existing data for reading, axios.put() to update items, and axios.delete() to remove items. These operations typically involve managing state within React components to reflect changes in data fetched from or sent to the backend.

Error handling is crucial in Axios CRUD projects to manage scenarios like network issues or failed API requests gracefully. Axios provides mechanisms to catch errors and handle them appropriately, ensuring a smoother user experience. Throughout development, test thoroughly to validate the functionality of each CRUD operation and ensure that your React application interacts correctly with the backend API. Once validated, deploy your application to a production environment, ensuring stability and performance for end users accessing your Axios CRUD project.
